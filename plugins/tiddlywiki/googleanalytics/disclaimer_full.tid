As many website do, this wiki uses [[Google Analytics|https://analytics.google.com]] (via the [[Google Analytics plugins|$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/googleanalytics]]) to help analyse how much visitors use this site and where they come from. Google uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. As ''internal link tracker is activated'' on this wiki, the tracker will send the title of each tiddler you're visiting (still anonymously though).

Your anonymity is safe here but you may wish to disable all tracking since data are sent to Google who may use them for marketing purpose. The plugin is compliant with [[Do Not Track|http://donottrack.us/]]. So, if you enable ''do not track'' option ''in your browser'' and reload the page the wiki will not collect and send any more data. You may also use privacy extensions to control which site can track you like. [[All About Do Not Track|https://allaboutdnt.com/]] website provide usefull informations about all this.
